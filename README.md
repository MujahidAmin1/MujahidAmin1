## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧱 Crafting intuitive UIs using **Material 3** and custom Flutter widgets  
- ⚙️ Managing app state effectively with **Provider**  
- 🔄 Integrating with **REST APIs**, modeling data, and using **Hive DB** for local storage  
- 📲 Building real-world projects like **BMI calculators**, **crypto trackers**, and **real estate apps**  
- ⚒️ Enhancing UX with **skeleton loaders**, custom validation, and reusable components  
- 💡 Applying academic knowledge in practical Flutter development (e.g., **SIWES** reports)  
- 🧠 Exploring advanced software topics: reliability, error detection, OSI model layers, and more  

I love taking ideas from concept to completion and writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.
